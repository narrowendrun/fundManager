Chaz – in the past, Revolve had shipped collateral under bailee to our vesting bank, Simmons Bank.  However, they’ve changed up management and will no longer act as bailee.  They still house most of our collateral post-close, but decided they didn’t want to be responsible prior to purchase I guess.  With that being said, would you be comfortable shipping under bailee directly to our office?
